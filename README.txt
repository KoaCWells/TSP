----Traveling Salesman Problem----
This project consists of two files: SimulatedAnnealing.java and TSP.java.

SimulatedAnnealing.java:
Attempts to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem via the process of simulated annealing.  Adjust the doubles T and cooling within the main in order to get different results.

TSP.java:
Attempts to the solve Traveling Salesman Problem via hill-climbing. Adjust ints number_of_generations and population_size at the beginning of the class in order to get different performance.
